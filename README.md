metaDR - (Metadata Replicated)
==============================

Introduction
=============
  This project provides a replicated in-memory metadata filesystem using Viewstamped Replication [1]. Most of the distributed systems have to manage metadata corresponding to the service that they provide.  For example, GFS [3] master node maintains the metadata of the entire filesystem. Zookeeper [2] provides a replicated metadata filesystem which can be used to implement other distributed services like locking, leader election etc. It is inevitable that this metadata need to be highly available as this can be a single point of failure. Viewstamped replication [1] provides the algorithm to achieve consensus in distributed systems. We are implementing a simple in-memory key-value store that is replicated and made highly available using viewstamped replication. We have modeled the key-value store interface to be similar to the one in zookeeper, where the key is in the format of UNIX filesystem path and value is a string.  At any point of time, there is a single primary and multiple backups. All the client requests have to be issued to the primary in order to guarantee strong consistency. When the primary fails, one of the backups changes role to primary. The system can tolerate ‘f’ failures where the total number of nodes in the system configuration is 2f + 1. The system is being implemented using C++11 on Linux based platform
